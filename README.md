theory
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is simple and easy to learn.
The print() function in Python is used to display output on the screen.
In this program:
Strings are used to display text ("Shardul Rasal").
Integers represent whole numbers (2).
Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable ([1,2,3,4,5]).
Variables (x, y, z) store different types of data.
The sep parameter in print() is used to separate multiple outputs with a specified symbol or format.
This program demonstrates how Python handles and prints different data types efficiently.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Import the required module (if any).
Use the print() function to display a string.
Print an integer value.
Print a list of numbers.
Assign values to variables x, y, and z.
Use the print() function with the sep parameter to display variables on separate lines.
Stop the program.


Conclusion
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates the use of the print() function in Python to display different data types such as strings, integers, lists, and variables. It also shows how output formatting can be controlled using the sep paramete
